AxoPy
=====

AxoPy is a system for creating human-computer interface experiments involving
the use of electrophysiological signals, such as electromyography (EMG) or
electroencephalography (EEG). It is intended to provide an infrastructure for
rapidly developing simple experiments while allowing for more complex designs.

This documentation is split into two major components: a :ref:`user guide
<user_guide>` and :ref:`API documentation <api>`. The API documentation covers
*what* the different modules of AxoPy can do, and the user guide is intended to
describe *how* to use these modules and how they work together.
